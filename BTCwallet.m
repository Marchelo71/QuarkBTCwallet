% After clicking randomly in a white screen to generate entropy, a paper wallet
% surges as in image, containing public and private keys (properly address and WIF) 
% expressed both in text and QR codes (in base58, as usual). 
% 
% Adress and private key (WIF) are also displayed in the command window 
%
% Optional outputs, pub_key and pr_key, are provided in hexadecimal format
%
% You should run this program offline to maximize your safety. Several
% functions, such as QRencoder, have been completely rewritten in native 
% Matlab language, so that everything should work fine offline and
% regardless of the Matlab version.

% This scritp calls the functions:   secp256k1 SHA256.m, ripemd160.m,

%  All the operations applied here, once we have a private key, are "one-way"        %

%  The bottleneck, or single point of failure of the whole process, is the           %
%  generation of the private key. It is supposed to be random and private, but       %
%  artificial devices generate pseudo-randomness and the Internet connection         %
%  can open back doors where your keys can be stolen.                                %
%                                                                                    %
%  That is why I explain here in detail each step of the process followed to         %
%  generate the private key, as it must be completely safe, random and transparent   %
%                                                                                    %
%  If you have a mathematical background you may be tempted to define another way    % 
%  to achieve randomness, since this system is really  simple. But, if you don't     %
%  have much knowledge, please be careful. Some mathematical operations can          %
%  induce a loss of randomness in each of the 64 digits that make up the private     %
%  key (in hexadecimal)                                                              %
%                                                                                    %
%  As an example, if an ideal die is rolled, the probability of each number is 1/6;  %
%  but if the sum of two ideal dice is recorded, the value '2' can only come out one % 
%  time out of all possible ones (as 1+1), while, the value '4' can come out as 1+3, %
%  2+2 and 3+1, i.e., it is three times more likely. If this happens in something as %
%  simple as addition, think that other more complicated operations can reduce even  %
%  more the randomness of the results                                                % 
%                                                                                    %
